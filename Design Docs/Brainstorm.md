# Brainstorm
Thinking of ideas for the game.

## Things I want
- Exciting places to explore
- Dangerous and interesting characters to meet
- A Seedship-like constructed ending telling you the future of things

## Things I don't want
- A linear "what do I click on / where do I go" style of gameplay
- A walking simulator
- A unsatisfyingly short game
- A game that isn't fun (for me particularly)

# What is the big question?
*What are the game mechanics going to be?*

More specifically:

*What will the challenge and satisfaction be?*

## Game Loop idea
- Look at map. Get excited about things to visit
- Visit a thing
- Have a surprising encounter there
- Have a challenge of some kind
- Leave the area excited and satisfied
