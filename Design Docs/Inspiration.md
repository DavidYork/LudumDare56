# Inspiration
Things I consumed to gain inspiration for the game jam.

## Secrets of NIMH
This story has exciting moments of going to dangerous places to meet dangerous characters. This is interesting. It also has moments of high stakes exciting stuff which I'm not sure how to gamify. I think the learning here is to create interesting, dangerous characters in interesting and dangerous locations to visit. These characters can move the plot forward and give the player more to explore.

I'd like to explore the city of rats more. What would be interesting to find? Dunno.

**Hook** She is questing to save her sick child.

### Mr Ages
Mr. Ages the wise doctor serves as a "move plot forward" / "tell protagonist what to do/where to go" and enables this.
- Tells Mrs. Brisby who Nicodemus is
- Takes her to Nicodemus (defeating the guard)
- Gives access to the "council of rats and mice"
- Visiting him is the first story goal, he's a doctor and provides medicine but then this trip results in meeting the crow which opens transportation.
- Maybe he's the one that advises seeing the owl? Either him or the crow.

### Nicodemus
Expository character and plot mover.
- Introduces magic amulet
- Explains Mrs. Frisbee's late husband's (Jonathan) death story (drugging cat)
- Explains Jonathan's role in rescuing the rats from NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health - the government program to make rats smarter) where rats and mice were prisoners
- He gets murdered by another rat because he's the king and the other rat wants to take over. The way this happens blocks saving Mrs. Frisby's kids

### Red Amulet
- Glows when worn of "one of courageous heart"
- Formerly property of Justin, later given to Mrs. Brisby
- Does random stuff that acts basically like a Deus Ex Machina

### Cat aka "Dragon"
Adds tension. Creates an exciting scene of drugging the cat that results in Mrs. Brisby getting captured. Then an escape.

## Pan's Labyrinth
The story is a child with a shit situation that enters a magic world where she is important, specifically a pricess that rules the underworld. It appears this story is "a girl has a shitty situation because of a war" followed by escapism into a magic realm that's probably inside her head.

**Hook** She is questing to save her sick mother.

### Fairy
- A little guy that sets the tone and seting.
- Drives the initial "desire to leave"

### Portal
- Warning about the portal followed by a friendly fairy telling the protagonist to go it.

### Staircase down the well
This is an interesting location.
- Staircase descending into a well going down into the earth
- At bottom is Pan and a cool obelisk and more fairies
- Pan gives her a "book of portals" which are blank pages

### Magic Book / Book of Portals
- When reading the book alone pages appear and talk about stuff.
- The book gives her quests (e.g. "put 3 magic stones inside a tree that's fucked because a giant toad lives under it). This is a fetch quest

### Magic tree
- Crawling under the tree results in an underground cave system, lots of nasty insects
- There is a giant nasty toad underground. It speaks and talks to protagonist
- She tricks it into eathing the magic stones which kills it
- Defeating it gives her a magic want or some such thing

### Feast
There is an entrance into a magic place with a feast. I think she gets there because the book tells her how, but it's from inside her home. She's told not to eat anything while there. She lets fairies into the area for some reason and unlocks a door for them but there is a blind evil-looking guy that (I guess) she's not allowed to wake up but she does because food. Inside the locked area she finds a special knife. The monster has eyes in his hands and way too much hanging skin (Japanese creature I think). It eats fairies. She then gets trapped inside because hourglass timer. She draws a new exit portal and escapes to her bedroom.
